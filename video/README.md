# video

Code-drawn visual assets for episodes rendered by the Gemini TTS factory.
Nothing here is used by the TTS worker itself.

## characters/

Five candidate hosts for the techforbadguys channel, drawn as parametric SVG
in `characters/characters.js`. Each `draw(expression)` takes

```js
{ lid: 0..1, look: -1..1, mouth: "smirk" | "talk" | "flat" }
```

so the chosen character can later be animated from an episode's audio and
word timestamps (blink, glance, mouth driven by the voice level).

| id | name | idea |
|---|---|---|
| `glitch` | GLITCH | A beige CRT monitor that grew horns and a devil-tail power cable |
| `redacted` | MR. REDACTED | Trench coat, fedora, and a redaction bar over the eyes |
| `byte` | BYTE | The villain's unimpressed black cat with an open padlock on its collar |
| `skully` | SKULLY | A skull news anchor with a headset and a bow tie |
| `bandit` | BANDIT | A smug raccoon in a hoodie, born with the mask on |

Rendered cards live in `characters/cards/`. Regenerate them with:

```bash
cd video && npm install --no-package-lock
node characters/render-sheet.cjs characters/cards   # needs Playwright + Chromium
```

Fonts come from the `@fontsource/*` packages in `package.json` (all OFL) plus
JetBrains Mono from the system.
